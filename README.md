# sotb-wrapper: A Python wrapper for the SEISCOPE optimization toolbox (using Ctypes)

This repo demonstrates how it is possible to use the [SEISCOPE optimization toolbox](https://seiscope2.osug.fr/SEISCOPE-OPTIMIZATION-TOOLBOX?lang=fr) (written in Fortran) from Python. The original code is public domain and was written by Ludovic MÃ©tivier
and Romain Brossier. Minor changes to the original code have been made to allow the call of the gradient-based optimization subroutines from Python. Such changes and some improvements are listed as follows. 
 * The original source organized in 6 subdirectories (each of which is associated with one gradient-based algorithm) was placed in only one folder in a modular fashion. That is, one module for each optimization algorithm grouping the procedures from each one of the old subdirectories.
 *  The Euclidean vector norm and scalar product calculations were replaced with calls to the intrinsic Fortran ```norm2``` and ```dot_product``` functions, respectively.
 *  Removing Trivial Code Duplication: i.e., same procedures in Steepest Descent and Preconditioned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient subdirectories.
 *  Removing unused variable declarations.
 *  Vectors of lower and upper bounds (box constraints) are now optional arguments in the optimization subroutines instead of array components of a derived data type

The SEISCOPE toolbox uses a derived data type (`optim`); functionality that is not yet supported at this time by f2py - and for this reason it is used [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html). The `optim` data type is maintained, but without allocatable arrays.

The repo contains a `src` directory with the modified fortran source files and another named `apps` where each method is used to find the minimum of the banana Rosenbrock function. The python wrapper for the SEISCOPE optimization toolbox is found inside the `sotb_wrapper` directory. A `test` directory includes a script to check that the wrapper has suceeded in reproducing the results of the original fortran code.

## Install Seiscope optimization toolbox (sotb)

If you only want to use the Fortran library, you can simply clone the repo and build it with [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) or [CMake](https://cmake.org/). In the first case you just need to run 
```bash
fpm build --profile release
```
This command creates the library in static form, as originally designed as well as executable files from demo codes. 

To use `sotb` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:

```yml
[dependencies]
sotb = { git="https://github.com/ofmla/seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes.git" }
```
In the second case, you can run a workflow as the following:
```bash
FC=gfortran cmake -B _build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build _build
cmake --install _build
```
where you need to replace `$PREFIX` with the desired directory.

Examples of use of `sotb` can be found in the `app` folder, which contains a folder with an example for each one of the optimization algorithms available in the library. The executable files for each example are built with `cmake` invocation above and made available at `$PREFIX/bin` folder. As mentioned before, when you use `fpm`, executable files for the examples are also created. In this latest case, you can use `fpm run --profile release <test_name>` to run an specific example. So, if you want to run the example that uses the limited-memory version of Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm, simply run `fpm run --profile release test_LBFGS`. If you run `fpm run --profile release` you can see the names of the six available examples. You can also find a simple example on calling the Fortran subroutines from a C main program in the [`c_code`](https://github.com/ofmla/seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes/tree/main/examples/c_code) directory. The example uses the L-BFGS to minimize the Rosenbrock's "banana function". Assuming that `$PREFIX` points to the repository root directory, you can create the executable from [`c_code`](https://github.com/ofmla/seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes/tree/main/examples/c_code) directory, by running 
```bash
cmake -S. -B _build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="`pwd`/../../"
cmake --build _build
```
or
```bash
cmake -S. -B _build -Dsotb_DIR="`pwd`/../../lib/cmake/sotb"
cmake --build _build
```
## Install the python wrapper of sotb (sotb-wrapper)

To install the Python API with the embedded `sotb` shared library you can use pip.
```bash
pip install sotb-wrapper
```
It is also possible to install directly from the GitHub repository. You will need a Fortran compiler such as GFortran to compile the shared library but the whole process is automated via [scikit-build](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build).
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ofmla/seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes
```
### Usage

The following example demonstrates how to define and solve the classical Rosenbrock problem
```python
import numpy as np
from sotb_wrapper import interface

# Declare the objective function
def rosenbrock(X):
    """
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function
    A generalized implementation is available
    as the scipy.optimize.rosen function
    """
    a = 1. - X[0]
    b = X[1] - X[0]*X[0]
    return a*a + b*b*100., np.array([-a*2. - 400.*X[0]*b, 200.*b], dtype=np.float32)
    
# Create an instance of the SEISCOPE optimization toolbox wrapper (sotb_wrapper) Class. 
sotb = interface.sotb_wrapper()
n = 2 # dimension
flag = 0 # first flag; 0 means initialization
X = np.ones(2, dtype=np.float32)*-1. # initial guess

# computation of the cost and gradient associated with the initial guess
fcost, grad = rosenbrock(X)
# copy of grad in grad_preco: no preconditioning in this test
grad_preco = np.copy(grad)
# Set parameters of the UserDefined derived type in Fortran (ctype structure).
# The first two parameters are mandatory; all others are optional. 
sotb.set_inputs(fcost, 10000, conv=1e-8, l=10)

# optimization loop: while convergence not reached or linesearch not failed, iterate
while (flag != 2 and flag != 4):
    flag = sotb.PSTD(n, X, fcost, grad, grad_preco, flag)
    if flag == 1:
        # compute cost and gradient at point x
        fcost, grad = rosenbrock(X)
        # no preconditioning in this test: simply copy grad in grad_preco
        grad_preco = np.copy(grad)
print('FINAL iterate is : ', X)
```

The code above is part of a tutorial in the form of a Jupyter notebook (`rosenbrock.ipynb`) provided in the [`examples`](https://github.com/ofmla/seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes/tree/main/examples) subdirectory. The goal of the tutorial is show you how one can use sotb-wrapper to find a minimum for a problem, which can optionally be subject to bound constraints (also called box constraints). The directory also includes examples in the context of geophysical inversion. Note that you must have [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) in order to be able to run them. A python script `plot_curves.py` is also provide in the `examples` directory. It may not be the best implementation and is intended for illustrative purposes only. 

The following figures were obtained with the `plot_curves.py` script after ran one of the examples (`lsrtm_aniso.py`).
